      Responsive Web Design 
    </h2>
    <p>Since people do not behave the same way on their mobile devices as they do on desktops, you as a web developer have to think about how visitors will use your site and what their expectations are. Then, you need to control the appearance and behavior of your site across multiple screen sizes and devices to meet users’ goals. To achieve this, you can follow an approach called responsive web design (RWD).</p>
    <p>This approach focuses on designing and developing websites so that the content is delivered to any device, size, or orientation giving users the same web experience between desktop, tablet, and smartphone. The main advantage to the RWD, apart from improving user experience, is that it makes the website easier to manage. Responsive design should be part of your overall multi-device strategy since it allows for easy access to content. Your users would be able to access content from any device they want and without having to download an app first.</p>
